# Bash Startup Files ( https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Startup-Files.html )

Invoked as an interactive login shell or with --login Bash executes commands from:
/etc/profile, then first found among ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, ~/.profile, in that order

When a login shell exits, executes commands from the file ~/.bash_logout, if it exists.

Invoked as an interactive non-login shell Bash reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc

So, typically, your ~/.bash_profile contains the line:
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi

Invoked non-interactively Bash behaves as if the following command were executed:
if [ -n "$BASH_ENV" ]; then . "$BASH_ENV"; fi
